# Configurations for OpenRouteService Infrastructure

For the moment, we use [tyk](https://tyk.io) as the API gateway, and
subscribe its [hybrid solution](https://tyk.io/hybrid-api-management/) solution. 

We use this repo to keep track of the configs, scripts and documents for all the ORS infrastructure including:

- API gateway
- Geocoding
- Load/performance tests
- Log analysis/filtering
