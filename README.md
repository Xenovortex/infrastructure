# Configurations for OpenRouteService API Gateway

We use [Kong](https://getkong.org) as the backend, and
[Konga](https://github.com/pantsel/konga) as the admin dashboard. Kong is
nginx+openresty based. And that's the reason why it is very flexible,
extensible and customizible. 

We use this repo to keep track of the configs, scripts and documents for the ORS API
Gateway.
