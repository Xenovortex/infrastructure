# Configurations for OpenRouteService API Gateway

For the moment, we use [Kong](https://getkong.org) as the backend, and
[Konga](https://github.com/pantsel/konga) as the admin dashboard. Kong is
based on [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) and [OpenResty](https://openresty.org). And that's the reason why it is very flexible,
extensible and customizible. 

We use this repo to keep track of the configs, scripts and documents for the ORS API
Gateway.
